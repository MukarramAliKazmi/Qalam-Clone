Qalam is a university management system, I have created this project as a semester project for Database Systems.

Setps for the beginners to use this project:
1. Install Node.JS and MySQL.
2. Open the folder in the terminal and write `npm install`.
3. Create a MySQL database on your computer, named QalamDatabase, and add all the tables you can fing in the QalamDatabase folder.
4. Set the user of the database to 'root' and password to 'password', you can change it later and update the code accordingly.
5. Write `npm start` in the terminal to start this project. The project should be running on the port `localhost:3000`.
